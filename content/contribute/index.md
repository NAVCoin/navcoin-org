  paragraphText="The issue tracker is the best place to find a useful way to contribute to NavCoin Core. Before starting to write any patches for issues you find, you may want to comment on the issue to make sure nobody else is already working on it. Remember that even if you’re resolving an issue you’ve found you will need to first create an issue in the issue tracker.<br>To resolve an issue follow this process:<br><ul style=\"color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.55);\"><li>Fork NavCoin/navcoin-core to your own GitHub account.</li><li>Create a branch to work in to resolve the issue then get to work.</li><li>Write or update unit and integration tests to cover any changes you’ve made.</li><li>Make a pull request from your branch back into the main NavCoin Core repository with the issue type and number in the title (eg. Trivial: fixes spelling mistake #145).</li><li>Talk with other NavCoin Core contributors on Discord or through GitHub to alert them to the pending Pull Request and they will review it as soon as possible.</li></ul><p class=\"paragraph-text\">For the full contribution workflow details, please see the readme on GitHub.</p>"

Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check.<br><br>There are also <a href=\"https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/tree/master/qa\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">regression and integration tests</a>, written in Python, that are run automatically on the build server."

  paragraphText="NavCoin Core is security software that helps protect assets worth millions of dollars, so every code change needs to be reviewed by experienced developers.<br><br>It can take a long time for other developers to review your pull requests. Remember that all reviewers are taking time away from their own projects to review your pull requests, so be patient and respectful of their time.<br><br>Please also consider helping to review other people’s pull requests. You don’t need to be an expert in NavCoin, the NavCoin Core codebase, or C++ (although all these things help). There are almost always open pull requests that any programmer can review."

titleText="Suggest a protocol improvement"
imgSrc="/images/governance/gov-benifits.svg"
paragraphText="NavCoin Core strives to continually improve the underlying protocol of NavCoin. Our aim is always to improve security, privacy and efficiency while encouraging decentralisation, uptake and usability. If you want to help us improve the NavCoin protocol, the best place to document your suggestion is on the NPIPs (NavCoin Protocol Improvement Proposals) GitHub repository.<br><br>People wishing to submit NPIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the NavCoin Core development community through Discord or IRC (irc.freenode.net #navcoin). After discussion, please open a PR to the NPIPs repository. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published there.<br><br>We are fairly liberal with approving NPIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.<br><br>Having a NPIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.<br><br>Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the NavCoin users."
