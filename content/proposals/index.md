        Do you have a great idea for a project that you’d like to share with the NavCoin community? Submit it to the NavCoin Community Fund and you could get paid to make it happen. It could be a protocol change, a new application, a website, promotional activity, or even something non-NavCoin related like a charity donation - it’s up to you. All you need to do is convince NavCoin stakers that your project is worth funding, and commit to following it through. The NavCoin Community Fund is the world’s first to use a dual consensus voting format to make sure that the best projects are brought to life.
