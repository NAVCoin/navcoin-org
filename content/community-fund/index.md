        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The NavCoin community fund is a pool of funds that are set aside to help kickstart community projects. NavCoin was built from the ground up - it’s an open-source community project that ran no premine or ICO. So as an extension of this ethos, this fund has been created to help incentivise the ongoing development of NavCoin in a decentralised manner.</p>
